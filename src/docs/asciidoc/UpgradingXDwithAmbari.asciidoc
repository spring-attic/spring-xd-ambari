Upgrading to Spring XD 1.3.1.RELEASE using Ambari
=================================================

These instructions apply to an installation using link:https://pivotalhd.docs.pivotal.io/docs/install-ambari.html[Pivotal Ambari] as well as link:https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.0.1.0/index.html[Hortonworks Ambari] using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 or CentOS 6.5. 

This document describes the upgrade process. For initial installation instructions please refer to link:InstallingXDwithAmbari.asciidoc[Installing Spring XD using Ambari].

Since Ambari does not yet support upgrading packages installed using an add-on plug-in we will have to perform a manual upgrade on all nodes that have Spring XD installed.

==== Stop the Spring XD Service

Use the Ambari UI to stop a running Spring XD service.

==== Upgrade all hosts that have a Spring XD component installed.

Log in as `root` on each node.

Add the new Spring XD 1.3 YUM repo:
[source,bash]
----
wget -nv https://repo.spring.io/yum-release/spring-xd/1.3/spring-xd-1.3.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/spring-xd-1.3.repo
----

Perform a regular YUM update operation:

[source,bash]
----
yum update spring-xd
----

NOTE: This has to be done on each host that has a Spring XD component installed.

==== Copy the HSQLDB database to the new installation

NOTE: This only applies to the host that has the "Spring XD HSQL Database" component for the XD Job information installed

NOTE: If you use an external database configured for the XD Job information, or you don't have any XD Jobs defined, then you don't need to do this.

Log in as `root` on the host that has the "Spring XD HSQL Database" component installed.

Check your Spring XD Ambari plugin version:
[source,bash]
----
yum list spring-xd-plugin-*
----

Look under `Installed Packages`, if the `spring-xd-plugin` is listed as version 1.2-2 or later, then no further action is needed. The datafiles are now stored in `/var/run/springxd/data/jobs`.

If the version is 1.2-1 then the datafiles are stored in `/opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/data/jobs` and we need to copy the ones from the old version to the newly installed one.

NOTE: This must be done after the YUM update command mentioned above

For an upgrade from Spring XD 1.2.1 execute this command to copy the files:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u spring-xd cp -r /opt/pivotal/spring-xd-1.2.1.RELEASE/xd/data/jobs/* /opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/data/jobs/.
----

For an upgrade from Spring XD 1.2.0 execute this command to copy the files:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u spring-xd cp -r /opt/pivotal/spring-xd-1.2.0.RELEASE/xd/data/jobs/* /opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/data/jobs/.
----

==== Start the Spring XD Service

Use the Ambari UI to start the Spring XD service.
