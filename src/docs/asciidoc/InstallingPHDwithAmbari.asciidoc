Installing Pivotal HD 3.0 on single-node VM using Ambari
========================================================

== Preparations

First we need a VM to work with. Follow the instructions in link:PreparingVMforAmbari.asciidoc[]

== Installing Ambari Server

We can follow steps 2.2 through 2.8 from the link:https://pivotalhd.docs.pivotal.io/docs/install-ambari.html#installing-ambari-server[Pivotal Ambari Installation Guide]

== Create Hadoop Cluster

We can follow steps 3.2 through 3.6 from the link:https://pivotalhd.docs.pivotal.io/docs/install-ambari.html#install-cluster[Pivotal Ambari Installation Guide]

I installed the PHD-3.0.0.0 and PHD-UTILS-1.1.0 stacks.

My Repository settings are (`hawaii` is the hostname for my YUM repo machine):

[width="80%",cols="1m,3m,6m",frame="topbot"]
|=====================================
|redhat6 |PHD-3.0             |https://hawaii/PHD-3.0.0.0
|        |PHD-UTILS-1.1.0.20  |https://hawaii/PHD-UTILS-1.1.0.20
|=====================================

I configured my single-node VMs hostname as the only host.

For the SSH Private key I used the one we generated on the VM. Just run this and cut-and-paste the key:

[source]
----
# cat .ssh/id_dsa
----

I ignored the warning about my hostname not beeing a FQDN.

For services to install I picked "HDFS", "YARN + MapReduce2", "Nagios", "Ganglia" and "ZooKeeper". Everything ends up on the single node.

You need to set password and alert email for Nagios.

The Hadoop cluster should now be operational.
